# luamemorybomb
A memory bomb designed to use the lua library for MAXIMUM DESTRUCTION!
## A little info
Ive switched over to linux and im starting to learn how to use C++ and WxWidgets. For now though, i figured i would release this little thing. What it does is it creates billions of instances of the lua interpreter, and then feeds that interpreter a lua file designed to meet maximum size that the memory allows! A little note of caution, my Lubuntu PC WAS NOT HAPPY when i ran this. It crashed with no recovery other than a full power reset. My PC has 32 GB of ram, so take that as a warning.
